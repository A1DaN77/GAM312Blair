Repository for my final project of GAM-312 Gameplay Systems Development at SNHU !!!


Comments for the final project submission:

Camera Use:
The implementation of camera libraries in gaming is crucial for providing an immersive 
experience within the gaming world. The camera acts as the players point of view which means
that if the camera usage is not done well, then the expereince and the immersion
will be just as bad. The camera allows the player to percieve the world, to interact with it,
and to connect with the it in ways that are only possible with the best camera usage.

Linear Algebra:
The use of linear algebra in gaming is one of, if not the most important parts of the
game development process. Its use in both 2D and 3D games range from character movement and 
physics to camera systems and rendering. It can not be undermined on just how important
and utterly neccessary that linear algebra is to games. Without it, you would not have any of
the aspects and game mechanics. Linear algebra is used in the AI movements, with directional
vectors and position in the world in relation to things such as worldy objects.
Its use in physics is also vastly important by using motion equations and working with 
collisions. All of which can be further expanded upon, in more detail.

Trace/Collision:
Trace and collision in gaming are important components of the physics and gameplay mechanics
within the games. These help the game be able to detect objects where they are, how 
they move, and how they interact with one another in the environment. Pretty straight
forward, some applications of this include; shooting with bullet pathing, interaction of
player with an object, and AI line of sight with the player.

AI:
Navigation mesh and pathfinding functionality in gaming are essential systems used to make
AI characters move through the game world in ways that make it seem human. Navigation mesh
allow for features such as navigation links (ie. jumping and climbing) and also covers
walkable surfaces (ie. floors, streets, grass). Pathfinding allows the AI to find the best
possible route from point A to point B, making it so that the AI also avoids obsticles and
hazards.
